\section{Introduction}

Soft robotics has in recent years enjoyed a surge in research interest. Traditional robots that use rigid materials for actuation tend to have poor adaptability and low human friendliness. Robots and actuators made with mechanically compliant materials may emerge more adaptable in unpredictable conditions and more comfortable for wearable use. 

Current soft robot actuation methods include chemical, pressure-based (pneumatic or hydraulic) and electroactive elastomer. Electromagnetic actuation that most traditional robots rely on has been mostly overlooked. Only four years ago, Jin et al. published \cite{jinStretchableLoudspeakerUsing2015}, the first paper that explored the idea. Jin introduced a voice coil speaker effective under large deformations. 

As a result, there is an opportunity add to the under-researched area of electromagnetic actuation for soft robots. Rigid electromagnetic actuation is a relatively mature field with a large existing corpus. 

Previously, electromagnetic actuation in soft robots was hindered by a lack of good conductors that maintain electrical properties under large deformations. Eutectic Gallium-Indium alloys (eGaIn) have emerged as a potential solution. eGaIn is a family of alloys that contain gallium, indium and sometimes tin and other metals. A typical eGaIn alloy can have 75\% Ga and 25\% In and melts at 15.5 \degree C \cite{dickeyEutecticGalliumIndiumEGaIn2008}, meaning it is liquid under room temperature. Liquid metal conductors can deform without large changes to material properties and do not undergo strain hardening or fatigue.

eGaIn is also advantageous among other liquid metals in that it has low toxicity \cite{dickeyEutecticGalliumIndiumEGaIn2008}, compared to mercury which is highly toxic. eGaIn is also stable in atmospheric conditions, compared to sodium-potassium alloy which is pyrophoric \cite{houghtonHazards2007}, and has low vapour pressure. eGaIn does however form an oxide layer on contact with oxygen which hinders its fluid and electrical properties \cite{liuCharacterizationNontoxicLiquidMetal2012}.

Using liquid metal in electromagnetic actuator coils also makes available a novel approach to cooling. The conductors themselves can be circulated and cooled externally, away from the rest of an actuator. This means that thermoregulation features such as cooling fins may become detached from the actuator, allowing for more compact designs where space is at a premium.

This project seeks to answer whether it is feasible to build an electromagnetic motor using liquid metal for wiring that can also be cooled via circulating metal in the wiring. To that end, an electromagnetic motor with eGaIn coils was designed, built and characterised. An analysis will also be conducted on whether eGaIn actuators hold promise for use in soft robots or for novel cooling approaches.

\section{Design, Manufacturing and Assembly}
\subsection{Mathematical Modelling}
\subsubsection{Motor Force}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:emmfdef}
\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{R} \Phi
\end{equation}
Magnetomotive force of a magnet can be calculated using total magnetic reluctance in a magnetic circuit and magnetic flux in that circuit, seen in equation \ref{eq:emmfdef}. This is analogous to electrical circuits following Ohm's law: magnetomotive force is analogous to voltage, reluctance is analogous to resistance and flux is analogous to current. Magnetomotive force in cylindrical magnets can be calculated using a short circuit scenario, i.e. by assuming poles of magnet are connected with minimal reluctance. Under the assumption that magnetic field density is uniform, the short circuit flux is equal to the remanence field density of the magnet multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the magnet normal to the direction of the magnetic field. In the case of an axially magnetised cylindrical magnet, this area is equal to the radial cross-section area of the cylinder.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:shortflux}
\Phi_0 = B_rA_{mag}
\end{equation}
Substituting equation \ref{eq:shortflux} into equation \ref{eq:emmfdef} gives a way to simply calculate $\mathcal{F}$ using axial length of magnet and remanent field density:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:emmf1}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{F} & = \mathcal{R}_{mag} \Phi_0\\
& = \frac{L_{mag}}{A_{mag}}B_r A_{mag}\\
& = L_{mag} B_r
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The magnetic circuit of a voice coil motor travels through four components in series: the magnet, the core, the "air" gap where the coils are and the shell, seen in figure \ref{fg:simplemotor}.
\begin{figure}[h!] 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{simplifiedMotor.png}
	\caption{Simplified axisymmetric diagram of typical moving-wire voice coil motor}
	\label{fg:simplemotor}
\end{figure}
This means the total reluctance in the circuit can be represented by equation \ref{eq:rttl}, similar to how resistance is calculated in an electrical circuit.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rttl}
\mathcal{R}_{total}=\mathcal{R}_{gap}+\mathcal{R}_{mag}+\mathcal{R}_{core}+\mathcal{R}_{shell}
\end{equation}
Magnetic reluctance can be calculated as the proportion of magnetic path length $l_m$ and the product of material permeability $\mu$ and cross-sectional area normal to magnetic flux $A$, seen in equation \ref{eq:rcalc} \cite{coatesTransformerCoresReluctance2018}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rcalc}
\mathcal{R}=\frac{l_m}{\mu A}
\end{equation}
Assuming the shell and core are made out of magnetically conductive material such as mild steel, the permeability of shell and core will be hundreds of times higher than the permeability of "air" gap and magnet \cite{engineeringtoolboxPermeability2016}. Therefore, the reluctance of shell and core can be approximated to zero for the purposes of this calculation. 
Substituting simplified equation \ref{eq:rttl} into equation \ref{eq:emmfdef} produces:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:emmfreal}
\mathcal{F}=(\mathcal{R}_{gap}+\mathcal{R}_{mag})\Phi
\end{equation}
Reluctance between two coaxial cylinders, in this case between the magnet and the shell, can be calculated as in equation \ref{eq:rgap}, assuming all magnetic flux flows through the core \cite{changChapterElectrodynamics2006}. Relative permeability of the gap is approximated to 1 as none of air, silicone or eGaIn are ferromagnetic \cite{engineeringtoolboxPermeability2016}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rgap}
\mathcal{R}_{gap}=\frac{\mu_0 \ln{\frac{r_{out}}{r_{in}}}}{2\pi L_{core}}
\end{equation}
Reluctance through the magnet can be calculated as seen in equation \ref{eq:rmag}, similar to how resistance would be calculated for a cylinder.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rmag}
\mathcal{R}_{mag}=\frac{\mu_m L_{mag}}{2\pi r_{mag}^2}
\end{equation}
Substituting equations \ref{eq:rgap}, \ref{eq:rmag} and \ref{eq:emmf1} into equation \ref{eq:emmfreal} gives equation \ref{eq:emmfsubbed} which yields flux in the motor magnetic circuit.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:emmfsubbed}
\begin{split}
L_m B_r & = \frac{\ln{\frac{r_{out}}{r_{in}}}}{2\pi L_c}\Phi\\
\frac{2\pi L_m L_c B_r}{\ln{\frac{r_{out}}{r_{in}}}} & = \Phi\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
To calculate the magnetic field density in the "air" gap, which can then be used to calculate force acting on the moving coils, the area of action that the flux is distributed across is also required as seen in equation \ref{eq:fluxdef}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fluxdef}
\Phi = B_{gap}A_{active}
\end{equation}
Substituting equation \ref{eq:fluxdef} into equation \ref{eq:emmfsubbed} gives equation \ref{eq:fluxsubbed}, which can be used to calculate the magnetic field density $B_{gap}$ across the "air" gap.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fluxsubbed}
B_{gap} = \frac{2\pi L_{mag} L_{core} B_r}{\ln{\frac{r_{out}}{r_{in}}}A_{active}}
\end{equation}
Using Lorentz's force law substituted with equation \ref{eq:fluxsubbed}, equation \ref{eq:fbil} gives a minimum current $I$ can be obtained given a known required force $F$ and a known length of wire i
n the magnetic field $L_{active}$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fbil}
\begin{split}
F & = B_{gap}IL_{active}\\
I & = \frac{F}{B_{gap}L_{active}}\\
I & = \frac{F A_{active} \ln{\frac{r_{out}}{r_{in}}}}{2\pi L_{mag} L_{core} B_r L_{active}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The active area in the magnetic field is different for each layer of wire in the motor. Layers of wire further away from the magnet, meaning a larger area and therefore lower magnetic field density. The total active area that magnetic flux is distributed across can be calculated as shown in equation \ref{eq:activearea}, where $n$ is the total number of wire layers.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:activearea}
A_{active} = \sum_{1}^{n}{A_{active}^{layer}} = 2\pi L_c (r_{core}-r_{wireout} + 2r_{wireout} \frac{(n+1)n}{2})
\end{equation}
The length of wire in the magnetic field can be calculated in a similar fashion, shown in equation \ref{eq:activel}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:activel}
L_{active} = L_{core}\pi(layers+1)layers + \frac{L_{core} r_{mag} \pi}{r_{wireOut}}
\end{equation}
Combining equations \ref{eq:fbil}, \ref{eq:activearea} and \ref{eq:activel} yields a final current calculation seen in equation \ref{eq:finalcurrent}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:finalcurrent}
I = \frac{F\cdot 2\pi L_c (r_{core}-r_{wireout} + 2r_{wireout} \frac{(n+1)n}{2}) \ln{\frac{r_{out}}{r_{in}}}}{2\pi L_{mag} L_{core} B_r L_{core}\pi(layers+1)layers + \frac{L_{core} r_{mag} \pi}{r_{wireOut}}}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Heat and Temperature}
A major challenge for designing electromagnetic motors is coil heat generation, and how to dissipate that heat. Energy is conserved in the motor system, as seen in figure \ref{fg:motorheat} and equation \ref{eq:pbreakdown}. As a result,  

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{motorheat.png}
\caption{Conservation of energy in the motor system}
\label{fg:motorheat}
\end{figure}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pbreakdown}
P_{in}=P_{out}=P_{mech}+P_{heat}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pin}
P_{in} = IV = I^2R
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:resistance}
R=\frac{L_{Wtotal}}{A\sigma}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pmechbreakdown}
\begin{split}
P_{mech} & = \vec{F}\vec{d}\\
& = BIL\cdot d_{travel} \cdot f
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Combining equations \ref{eq:pin}, \ref{eq:resistance}, \ref{eq:pbreakdown} and \ref{eq:pmechbreakdown} gives a formulation for temperature change of wires, assuming heat energy is conserved in wires:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pheatbreakdown}
\begin{split}
P_{heat} & = P_{in}-P_{mech}\\
\rho Q c_{pWire} \Delta T & = \frac{I^2L_{Wtotal}}{A\sigma}-BIL\cdot d \cdot f \\
\Delta T & = \frac{\frac{I^2L_{Wtotal}}{A\sigma}-BIL\cdot d \cdot f}{\rho Q c_{pWire}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end{table}

Optimisation was conducted assuming the use of 2 mm internal diameter, 3 mm external diameter silicone tubing for wiring. This was the tubing with largest internal volume to total volume ratio that was commercially available.

The optimisation software produced physical dimensions, pump flow and pressure requirements, electrical input requirements and an axisymmetric cross-section diagram to show scale of the optimised motor for each number of layers that the optimisation was run for.

\subsubsection{Health, Safety and Containment}
Gallium, indium and eGaIn are not toxic to touch, but can cause harm if ingested or inhaled.

However, eGaIn is known to be corrosive towards most solid metals including iron, copper and aluminium alloys \cite{cuiLiquidMetalCorrosion2018}. In particular, without specific surface treatment, aluminium parts in the lab may corrode on contact with eGaIn.

Everything done in fish bin, done in a corner of the lab away from metal components that can be damaged.

To avoid accidental ingestion after handling eGaIn, disposable gloves were worn whenever there was possible exposure to eGaIn.

\section{Discussion}

Application to the original physical situation\\ 

Comparison with related problems and other solutions\\

If the eGaIn in the final motor design was substituted for copper threaded through silicone tubing, the motor would require much less power to produce the same force output. A motor of the same size filled with copper coils of the same diameter instead of eGaIn will consume under half of the power for the same force output. If the volume of the wiring was substituted entirely for 0.22 mm diameter copper wire, a common type of wire used for electromagnetic motors of this force scale, the motor would draw ~18 times less power to produce the same force.
