        There’s three immediate future research topics that this project exposed.

        First, the motor is not currently deformable. Future research can investigate constructing a fully deformable motor.
        
        Second, a custom coil body should be investigated instead of using off-the-shelf silicone tubing. Low efficiency may be addressed by putting more coil into the same space and improving the fill factor.
        
        Finally, controlled circulation of eGaIn in wires and external cooling of eGaIn will also need to be tested. Since eGaIn is corrosive to most cooling mechanisms on the market, there’ll also need to be research into cooling mechanisms made out of exotic materials.
